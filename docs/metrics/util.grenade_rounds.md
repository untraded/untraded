Rounds the player started with at least one grenade in the inventory.

## Example

On the `premier-half` fixture: a Premier match on de_cache, rounds 11 to 15, anonymized players.

| A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | B1 | B2 | B3 | B4 | B5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 |

## Against CS Demo Manager

No equivalent in CS Demo Manager.

## Limits

- Blinds of players already dead are ignored. Blind durations are the engine's, which already depend on the distance and the angle to the flash.
